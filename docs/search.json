However, they tested specific a priori hypotheses and interested in the overall pattern of stressor-cortisol concordance rather than statistical significance. Moreover, they adjusted for a range of potential confounders which, had we not accounted for these variables, would have led to spurious associations.​"

These findings do not support the notion that all individuals at CHR for psychosis show HPA hyperresponsiveness to psychosocial stressors. Instead, CHR individuals vary in their response to stressor exposure/distress, perhaps driven by genetic or other vulnerability factors.​\n​"

    "text": "Limitations\nAnother limitation is that a small proportion of participants (16%), experienced a long delay (&gt; two months) between baseline assessment visits, which led to a large lapse-of-time between completion of psychosocial stressor assessments and cortisol collection.​\nOne major limitation is that they only examined three stressor types. There are other stressors such as urbanicity, neighborhood cohesion, and socioeconomic deprivation relevant to psychosis that might impact the HPA axis function. Considering this, it is possible that examining a wider range of stressors might yield different patterns of stressor-cortisol concordance across CHR subgroups. ​\nTheir findings are also specific to basal salivary cortisol, other measures such as plasma cortisol, salivary diurnal or awakening cortisol profiles may have produced different results.​\n​"

It is possible that stressor-cortisol concordance at follow-up does in fact distinguish between CHR subgroups, but that their measure at baseline was too distal to outcome. ​\nLastly, CHR individuals are at elevated risk for a wide range of psychiatric disorders, particularly depression and anxiety (Addington et al., 2017; Addington et al., 2019), and so worsening of prodromal symptoms/transition to psychosis is only one of several potential outcome measures, all of which will inevitably involve more false negatives the shorter the follow-up period. A recent study suggested that well-established risk factors are better at predicting poor functioning in CHR populations than transition to psychosis (Zhang et al., 2019). The extent to which stressor-cortisol concordance at baseline is associated with other non-psychotic disorders and functioning at follow-up is therefore warranted.​"

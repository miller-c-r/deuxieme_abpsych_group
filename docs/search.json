Following the perception of a stressor, the hypothalamus releases CRF, which activates the pituitary and leads to secretion of ACTH. The levels of ACTH are detected by the adrenal cortex which then secretes glucocorticoids and catecholamines"

In sum, the forward loop prepares the organism to anticipate and respond optimally to a threat, while the feedback loop ensures returning efficiently to a homeostatic balance when it is no longer challenged"

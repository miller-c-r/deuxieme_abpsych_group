A recent study suggested that well-established risk factors are better at predicting poor functioning in CHR populations than transition to psychosis (Zhang et al., 2019). The extent to which stressor-cortisol concordance at baseline is associated with other non-psychotic disorders and functioning at follow-up is therefore warranted.​"

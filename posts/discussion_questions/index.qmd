## Discussion Questions

This research has shed light on the complexity of how endocrine pathways affect and/or determine behaviors, therefore playing a role in neuropsychiatric disorders. Let's talk more about this.​ ​

-   Just to recap from what we've learned in class- What are some types of psychosocial stressors? Hint​

-   What are some indicators of the early onset of psychosis?​

-   Is psychosocial stress alone necessary and sufficient to trigger the onset of psychosis? ​

-   When considering critical development periods, what role does age play when considering cortisol levels?​

-   What etiological or causal factors might moderate the association between psychosocial stress and a risk of psychosis or cortisol responses? ​

-   Do you think there are sex differences with respect to cortisol responses are of relevance to the pathophysiology of psychosis? Why or why not?​

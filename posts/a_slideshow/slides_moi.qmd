## Key Terms {.scrollable}

**Prodrome/ Prodromal**

-   APA defines prodrome as an early symptom or symptoms of a mental or physical disorder. A prodrome frequently serves as a warning or premonitory sign that may, in some cases, enable preventive measures to be taken. ​

**Diathesis**

-   predisposition toward a particular state or condition and especially one that is abnormal or diseased (Merriam-Webster, n.d.)​

-   ​The stress diathesis model postulates the interaction between a genetic vulnerability or predisposition and adverse life events in the genesis of \[a disorder\] (Ladd, Charlotte O., Huot, Rebecca L. , et. al, 2000)​ <!-- -->

**Endocrine Sytem**​

-   The endocrine system consists of: Glands located throughout the body; Hormones made by the glands and released into the bloodstream or the fluid surrounding cells; and Receptors in various organs and tissues that recognize and respond to the hormones.​

​

## Key Terms​

**Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) Axis​**

-   Involves the The Hypothalamus, Pituitary Gland and Adrenal Glands​

-   Activates stress systems on exposure to a stressor​

**Neural Diathesis Stress Model**​

Postulates increased vulnerability to psychological disorders due to genetic factors, perinatal, or prenatal factors. Psychological stressors and various factors predispose individuals to various psychological disorders

## Background Research

## Background {.scrollable}

1997 Schizophrenia: A neural diathesis-stress model​

This article hypothesized about the neural mechanisms involved in the effects of stressors on the diathesis. Both the behavioral and biological data indicate that stress worsens symptoms, and that the diathesis is associated with a heightened response to stressors.​

​

## A Brief Review of the Hypothalamus, Pituitary Gland and the Endocrine System​

## The Endocrine System

The endocrine system is made up of all of the body's different hormones, regulates all biological processes in the body​

This includes development of the brain and nervous system, the growth and function of the reproductive system, as well as the metabolism and blood sugar levels.(EPA, 2023).​

It includes the hypothalamus, pituitary adrenals and other glands.​

##  {background-image="endocrine_system.jpg" background-size="600px"}

## The Hypothalamus & The Pituitary Gland

##  {background-image="yale_brain.png" background-size="800px"}

## The Hypothalamus

The hypothalamus links our nervous and endocrine systems together, it drives the endocrine system (EPA , 2023) ​

​

The hypothalamus monitors internal systems keeping homeostasis through its neural connections, controlling the release of various hormones.​

​

It regulates sleep, hunger, thirst, body temperature, blood pressure, hormone secretion and water balance​

​

## The Pituitary Gland

## The Pituitary Gland Part I {.scrollable}

The pituitary gland is intimately linked to the hypothalamus​

It is sometimes designated as the master gland. It is about the size of an acorn. The pituitary is actually two glands in one: The anterior pituitary, the posterior pituitary​

The anterior pituitary contains endocrine cells which produce several hormones under tight control by the neurons in the hypothalamic nuclei(Jubb, 2016):

1.  adrenocorticotropic hormone \[ACTH\]
2.  thyroid‐stimulating hormone \[TSH\]
3.  follicle‐stimulating hormone \[FSH\]
4.  luteinizing hormone \[LH\]
5.  growth hormone \[GH\]
6.  prolactin \[PRL\])

##  {background-image="jubb_hpa_axis.png" background-size="600px"}

**The HPA Axis**

## HPA Axis Part I

The body activates stress systems on exposure to a stressor; the autonomic nervous system initiates a rapid and relatively short-lived "flight or fight" response, whilst the HPA axis is slower, a more protracted response. (Jubb, 2016).​

## HPA Part II

Tight regulation of the HPA axis is core to the long-term control of systems governing stress responsivity​

​

Following a stressor corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) and Vasopressin (AVP) are released from the hypothalamus​

​

They stimulate the release of Adreno-corticotropic hormone (ACTH) from the anterior pituitary. (Jubb, 2016).​

The adrenal cortex then releases glucocorticoid hormones , cortisol/ corticosterone (stress hormones).

## The Neuroscience Paradigm {.scrollable}

​

There are 3 main components ​

-Neurons and neurotransmitters​

-Brain structure and function​

-Neuroendocrine system (hormones)​

The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA) is the main stress response system. It is the neuroendocrine link between perceived stress and physiological reactions to stress (Breedlove and Watson, 2013)​

The neural diathesis stress model for psychosis abnormalities in the HPA axis puts individuals at increased vulnerability for psychosis. ​

Individuals with increased vulnerability for psychosis are more sensitive to the effects of psychosocial stressors due to abnormalities within the HPA which in turn eventually trigger expression of psychotic illness.​

Patients with psychosis exhibit elevated basal cortisol relative to healthy controls.​

## Question {.scrollable}

Broad Question- Elevations in basal cortisol levels have been reported among individuals at-risk for psychosis, the extent to which this represents hyperresponsivity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis to psychosocial stressors encountered in the natural environment is currently unclear.​

Specific Question- They examined stressor-cortisol concordance among youth at clinical high-risk (CHR) for psychosis in the North American Prodrome Longitudinal Study 2 (NAPLS 2) and the relationship with clinical outcome.​

Specific Question- Determining the extent to which HPA axis responsivity in at-risk youth predicts clinical outcome is important, as such work might ultimately help to identify individuals at increased risk of illness progression by virtue of being more sensitive to the effects of psychosocial stress, enabling targeted interventions.​

​

## Hypothesis {.scrollable}

They hypothesized that CHR youth who later converted to psychosis would show (a) greater exposure and distress in relation to psychosocial stressors, (b) elevated basal cortisol, and (c) higher stressor-cortisol concordance relative to healthy controls; ​

Alternative Hypothesis ---\> CHR non-converters would be intermediate to CHR converters subgroups and healthy controls (i.e., converters \> positive symptom progression \> symptomatic \> remitted \> controls) on these measures. ​

## Logic and Design {.scrollable}

Cullen et. al aimed to further characterize the nature of HPA axis abnormalities among individuals at-risk for psychosis by examining psychosocial stressors, basal cortisol, and the concordance between these measures in a large sample of CHR youth categorized according to clinical status at the two-year follow-up.​

They utilized data from the North American Prodrome Longitudinal Study 2 (NAPLS 2) and investigated whether psychosocial stressors, basal cortisol levels, and stressor-cortisol concordance (i.e., the magnitude of association between psychosocial stressors and cortisol) at the baseline assessment differed across healthy controls and CHR subgroups defined on the basis of their clinical presentation at the two-year follow-up (remitted, symptomatic, progression of positive symptoms, and converted to psychosis).​

## Methods

Subjects:​

662 Participants​

12-35 years at age of recruitment​

Two groups: CHR subjects (clinical high-risk) for psychosis in the North American Prodrome Longitudinal Study 2 (NAPLS 2) and Healthy controls​

​

## Methods {.scrollable}

Three stress measures were utilized.

Stress measures were recorded using:​

-   58 item, Daily Stress Inventory,​

-   Life events were assessed via the Psychiatric Epidemiology Research Interview Life Events Scale that was modified to exclude life events of lesser relevance to youth (divorce and financial losses) ​

-   Lastly participants completed the Childhood Trauma and Abuse Scale, a semi-structured interview examining experiences of physical, sexual, and psychological abuse and emotional neglect prior to the age of 16. ​

​

## Methods

Researchers assessed HPA axis function using basal salivary cortisol collected in the laboratory, as it is more reliable and, unlike home sampling methods, unlikely to be influenced by confounding factors such as exercise. ​

Prodromal symptoms were assessed via the Structured Interview for Prodromal Syndromes (SIPS) at 12- and 24-month follow-up assessments and used to categorise CHR subgroups​

## Methods cont'd {.scrollable}

​

At the research session subjects provided 3 saliva samples, one per hour with a mean salivary cortisol value subsequently derived when two or more samples were available.​

​

​

Researchers created a Five- level categorical variable consisting of​

Cortisol collected before the stress measurement​

Cortisol same day as stressor assessments​

Cortisol 1-10 days after stress measurement​

Cortisol 11-30 days after​

Cortisol \> 30 days after​

​

Confidence Intervals Representing the Magnitude of Stressor Cortisol Concordance

## Results

Of the 457 CHR individuals included in the current study: ​

134 (29.3%) showed a remission of CHR symptoms​

130 (28.4%) remained symptomatic​

124 (27.1%) experienced a progression of positive symptoms​

69 (15.1%) converted to psychosis. ​

## Inferences

Stress measures versus basal cortisol​

Daily stressor distress was significantly associated with cortisol in controls and CHR converters​

None of the stress measures: 58-item Daily Stress Inventory ;Psychiatric Epidemiology Research Interview Life Events Scale; Childhood trauma and abuse scale, were significantly associated with cortisol in the CHR remitted, symptomatic or progressed subgroups​

​

## Result {.scrollable}

Observation: Poor concordance between naturally occurring psychosocial stressors and cortisol responses in psychosis. The authors noted that this observation should be interpreted with caution due to limited statistical power at the level of meta-analysis and individual studies, heterogeneity of study measures and populations as well as differences in timing of cortisol measurement with respect to the onset of stressor. ​

## Inferences {.scrollable}

Stress measures versus basal cortisol​

-   Daily stressor distress was significantly associated with cortisol in controls and CHR converters​

-   None of the stress measures: 58-item Daily Stress Inventory ;Psychiatric Epidemiology Research Interview Life Events Scale; Childhood trauma and abuse scale, were significantly associated with cortisol in the CHR remitted, symptomatic or progressed subgroups​

## Inferences {.scrollable}

In conclusion, in line with their hypothesis, while **all CHR subgroups** showed increased psychosocial stress exposure and distress relative to controls, ​

Only those who later converted to psychosis **(CHR converters)** were characterized by significantly elevated basal cortisol levels. ​

Moreover, only CHR converters showed a higher magnitude of **stressor-cortisol concordance** compared to controls, ​

although confidence intervals overlapped considerably between these two groups. These findings do not support the notion that all individuals at CHR for psychosis show HPA hyperresponsiveness to psychosocial stressors. Instead, **CHR individuals vary** in their response to stressor exposure/distress, perhaps driven by genetic or other vulnerability factors.​

​

## Inferences

Exact mechanisms underlying HPA responsivity to stress are unknown and likely complex​

There are individual differences in responsivity that are likely due to genetic variants​

FKBP5, CRHR1, NR3C1, NR3C2 that modify the effect of acute and chronic stress/trauma on cortisol levels in healthy adolescents and adults and patients with psychosis​

​

## Limitations {.scrollable}

Individual CHR subgroups were small (particularly the converted group) and reduced their ability to detect statistically significant associations between psychosocial stressors and cortisol.​

They did not adjust for multiple comparisons in their primary analyses examining stressor-cortisol concordance and some significant associations arose by chance. However, they tested specific a priori hypotheses and interested in the overall pattern of stressor-cortisol concordance rather than statistical significance. Moreover, they adjusted for a range of potential confounders which, had we not accounted for these variables, would have led to spurious associations.​

## Limitations {.scrollable}

Another limitation is that a small proportion of participants (16%), experienced a long delay (\> two months) between baseline assessment visits, which led to a large lapse-of-time between completion of psychosocial stressor assessments and cortisol collection.​

One major limitation is that they only examined three stressor types. There are other stressors such as urbanicity, neighborhood cohesion, and socioeconomic deprivation relevant to psychosis that might impact the HPA axis function. Considering this, it is possible that examining a wider range of stressors might yield different patterns of stressor-cortisol concordance across CHR subgroups. ​

Their findings are also specific to basal salivary cortisol, other measures such as plasma cortisol, salivary diurnal or awakening cortisol profiles may have produced different results.​

​

## Limitations {.scrollable}

They did not account for psychosocial stressors and other confounding factors/events that may have occurred in the time between baseline and follow-up. It is possible that stressor-cortisol concordance at follow-up does in fact distinguish between CHR subgroups, but that their measure at baseline was too distal to outcome. ​

Lastly, CHR individuals are at elevated risk for a wide range of psychiatric disorders, particularly depression and anxiety (Addington et al., 2017; Addington et al., 2019), and so worsening of prodromal symptoms/transition to psychosis is only one of several potential outcome measures, all of which will inevitably involve more false negatives the shorter the follow-up period. A recent study suggested that well-established risk factors are better at predicting poor functioning in CHR populations than transition to psychosis (Zhang et al., 2019). The extent to which stressor-cortisol concordance at baseline is associated with other non-psychotic disorders and functioning at follow-up is therefore warranted.​

## Future Research

How to approach future research​

-   Varying assessments of cortisol, in collection​

-   Neuroimaging of various structures involved in mediating HPA axis function​

-   Pituitary affinity for glucocorticoid receptors​

-   Differences between sex​

-   Polymorphism in genes for glucocorticoid receptor proteins​

## Selected Article {.scrollable}

A meta-analysis of blood and salivary cortisol levels in first-episode psychosis and high-risk individuals​

https://doi.org/10.1016/j.yfrne.2021.100930​

​

Why we chose this article​ {.scrollable}

Previous meta-analyses have only addressed single parameters of the HPA axis activity and have not considered cortisol levels in blood and saliva separately as well as their association with other hormonal and metabolic alterations reported in this population, including impaired glucose homeostasis (Pillinger et al., 2017) and altered levels of DHEA or DHEA-S (Misiak et al., 2018). ​

Another shortcoming of previous research is the lack of a systematic comparison of baseline cortisol levels and cortisol levels in response to stimulation. ​

Lastly, there is some evidence that unaffected relatives of individuals with psychosis show increased emotional reactivity to daily life stress, increased ACTH levels in response to stress, increased pituitary volume and reduced hippocampal volume (Aiello et al., 2012). ​

​

## The Meta-Analysis {.scrollable}

A meta-analysis of blood and salivary cortisol levels in first-episode psychosis and high-risk individuals​ Błazej ˙ Misiak, Marita Pruessner, Jerzy Samochowiec, Michał Wi´sniewski, Artur Reginia & Bartłomiej Stanczykiewicz ​

Hypothesis- They aimed to perform a meta-analysis investigating baseline cortisol levels and cortisol levels in response to stimulation in blood and saliva in subjects with first-episode psychosis (FEP), CHR individuals, as well as unaffected relatives of individuals with schizophrenia, taking into consideration a number of potential moderators such as the levels of glucose, insulin, DHEA and DHEA-S as well as lipid profile. ​

​## Methods and Results

## Methods​

47 studies were included in the meta-analysis​

-   1327 patients with FEP (range of mean age: 20.6 -- 33.7 years, range of percentage of males: 45.2 -- 100%)​

-   932 CHR individuals (range of mean age: 14.2 -- 24.5 years, range of percentage of males: 42.9 -- 100%)​

-   242 FHR(Individuals at familial risk) individuals (range of mean age: 13.3 -- 39.3 years, range of percentage of males: 32.4 -- 73.7%) 2203 healthy controls (range of mean age: 13.1 -- 37.3 years, range of percentage of males: 38.1 -- 100%). ​

​

​

## Results {.scrollable}

Unstimulated blood cortisol

-   27 studies investigated levels of blood cortisol

-   Blood cortisol levels were significantly higher in patients with FEP

-   Not individuals at high risk for psychosis compared to healthy controls

Unstimulated salivary cortisol

-   18 studies utilized for investigation of salivary cortisol levels

-   There were no significant differences in unstimulated salivary cortisol levels between patients with FEP and healthy controls

-   No significant differences were found between CHR converters and non converters

-   further analysis with the leave one out sensitivity analysis revealed salivary cortisol levels were significantly higher in CHR individuals compared to healthy controls

## Results

CAR (Cortisol Awakening Response)

-   CAR was significantly attentuated in subjects with FEP

-   Not in high-risk individuals

-   Pruessner et al. males with FEP had significantly lower CAR compared to females with FEP and male controls

​

## Discussion {.scrollable}

-   Blood cortisol levels were not associated with between group differences in age, sex

-   Effect size estimates for blood cortisol levels are significantly associated with those for the levels of glucose and insulin

-   Consistent with previous studies regarding abnormal glucose homeostasis parameters in unmedicated patients with FEP enhanced activity of the HPA axis contributes to impaired glucose homeostasis

## Contrasting the Two articles

-   The meta analysis was able to compare First Episode Psychosis (FEP) patients with CHR individuals and healthy controls. The previous study was investigating salivary cortisol as it relates to symptom progression in CHR individuals

-   One study in the meta analysis included first degree relative that was unaffected.

    -   children that displayed a blunted CAR

## Discussion Questions {.scrollable}

This research has shed light on the complexity of how endocrine pathways affect and/or determine behaviors, therefore playing a role in neuropsychiatric disorders. Let's talk more about this.​ ​

-   Just to recap from what we've learned in class- What are some types of psychosocial stressors? Hint​

-   What are some indicators of the early onset of psychosis?​

-   Is psychosocial stress alone necessary and sufficient to trigger the onset of psychosis? ​

-   When considering critical development periods, what role does age play when considering cortisol levels?​

-   What etiological or causal factors might moderate the association between psychosocial stress and a risk of psychosis or cortisol responses? ​

-   Do you think there are sex differences with respect to cortisol responses are of relevance to the pathophysiology of psychosis? Why or why not?​

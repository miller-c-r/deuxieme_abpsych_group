Stressor-Cortisol Concordance Among Individuals at Clinical High-Risk for Psychosis: Novel Findings from the NAPLS Cohort

## Key Terms

1.  Concordance

2.  HPA dysregulation

3.  Prodrome/ Prodromal

4.  Endocrine System

5.  HPA Axis

<!-- -->

## Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal(HPA) axis

##  {background-image="jubb_hpa_axis.png" background-size="600px"}

## HPA Part I

The body activates stress systems on exposure to a stressor; the autonomic nervous system initiates a rapid and relatively short‐lived 'fight‐or‐flight' response, whilst the HPA axis is slower, instigating a more protracted response.

## HPA Part II

Tight regulation of the HPA axis is core to the long‐term control of systems governing stress responsivity.

Following a stressor, the neuropeptides corticotropin‐releasing hormone (CRH) and argi-nine vasopressin (AVP) are released from the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothala-mus into the portal vessel system.

## HPA Part III

These bind specific receptors (the CRHR1 and V1b receptors for CRH and AVP, respectively) in the anterior pituitary that stimulate the release of adreno-corticotropic hormone (ACTH). (Jubb, 2016)

## HPA Part IV

Schematic representation of the hypothalamic-pituitary--adrenal (HPA) axis. Following the perception of a stressor, the hypothalamus releases CRF, which activates the pituitary and leads to secretion of ACTH. The levels of ACTH are detected by the adrenal cortex which then secretes glucocorticoids and catecholamines

## HPA Part V

This in turn acts on the adrenal cortex to synthesize and release glucocorticoid hormones, i.e. cortisol/corticosterone. These then mobilize glucose from energy stores and increase cardiovascular tone, among further widespread effects.

## HPA Part VI

Feedback loops, primarily mediated at the PVN and pituitary through glucocorticoid receptors (GR), restrain the responsiveness of the HPA axis to reset the system to baseline activity (Figure 6.1).

In sum, the forward loop prepares the organism to anticipate and respond optimally to a threat, while the feedback loop ensures returning efficiently to a homeostatic balance when it is no longer challenged

## The Endocrine System Part I

The endocrine system, made up of all the body's different hormones, regulates all biological processes in the body.

Including the development of the brain and nervous system, the growth and function of the reproductive system, as well as the metabolism and blood sugar levels.(EPA, 2023 )

##  {background-image="endocrine_system.jpg" background-size="600px"}

## Endocrine System Part II

The Hypothalamus, Pituitary Gland, Thyroid Gland

The Adrenal Glands, Pancreas, Gonads Female Ovaries, Male Testis

For example: Pancreas - The pancreas is responsible for producing glucagon and insulin. Both hormones help regulate the concentration of glucose (sugar) in the blood.

## Hypothalamus & Pituitary Gland

## Hypothalamus Part I

Hypothalamus - The hypothalamus links our endocrine and nervous systems together. The hypothalamus drives the endocrine system.(EPA, 2023)

The hypothalamus monitors the internal systems keeping homeostasis through its neural connections, controlling the release of various hormones.

## Hypothalamus Part II

It regulates sleep, hunger, thirst, body temperature, blood pressure, hormone secretion, and water balance. The hypothalamus interacts mostly with the nervous system, and the endocrine system, stimulating organs to release hormones. It is only the size of a dime.

## Pituitary Gland Part I

It is sometimes designated as the master gland. It is about the size of an acorn. The pituitary is actually two glands in one, the posterior and anterior.

## Pituitary Gland Part II

The posterior pituitary manufactures no hormones of its own, but stores two hormones that are initially secreted in a part of the brain known as the hypothalamus. The hormones are oxytocin, which is believed to stimulate labor at the end of pregnancy, and vasopressin, which helps the body retains its fluids.

## Pituitary Gland Part III

The anterior pituitary controls the overall growth of the body. The anterior portion has many functions and several of its hormones have been isolated.

## Pituitary Gland Part IV

The anterior pituitary contains endocrine cells which produce several hormones (adrenocorticotropic hormone \[ACTH\], thyroid‐stimulating hormone \[TSH\], follicle‐stimulating hormone \[FSH\], luteinizing hormone \[LH\[, growth hormone \[GH\], prolactin \[PRL\])

## Pituitary Gland Part IV

Under tight control of hormones produced by the neurons in hypothalamic nuclei, and delivered to the anterior pituitary via the portal system, 'skipping' the general circulation. (Jubb 2016)

## The Journal Article

### Background

The neural diathesis stress model and clinical risk for psychosis Abnormalities in the HPA axis , places individuals at increased vulnerability for psychosis

## A QALMRI

## Question

## Broad Question

Elevations in basal cortisol levels have been reported among individuals at-risk for psychosis, the extent to which this represents hyperresponsivity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis to psychosocial stressors encountered in the natural environment is currently **unclear**.

## Question

## Specific Question

Examining stressor-cortisol concordance among youth at clinical high-risk (CHR) for psychosis in the North American Prodrome Longitudinal Study 2 (NAPLS 2) and the relationship with clinical outcome.

## Specific Question

Determining the extent to which HPA axis responsivity in at-risk youth predicts clinical outcome is important

## Specific Question

### Authors Hypothesized Three Predicted Outcomes for CHR youth who converted to psychosis

CHR youth who later converted to psychosis would show:

1.  Greater exposure and distress in relation to psychosocial stressors

2.  Elevated basal cortisol

3.  Higher stressor-cortisol concordance relative to healthy controls

## Specific Question

### Authors Hypothesized the Following Predicted Outcome for CH youth "nonconverters"

CHR nonconverters: Would be intermediate to CHR converters subgroups and healthy controls. Determined by measurement of positive symptom progression.

## Methods

Utilizing data from North American Prodrome Longitudinal Study 2 NAPLS 2

## Methods

### Subjects:

1.  662 participants

2.  Age

3.  CHR subjects

<!-- -->

## Methods

#### CHR Subjects:

a.  Exclusion criteria
    1.  Axis-1 psychotic disorder
    2.  Permitted treatment with antipsychotic medication provided full psychotic symptoms were not present at the time of medication commencement

## Methods

### CHR Subjects cont'd

b.  Initial assessment

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
1.  Conducted by clinically trained interviewers

2.  Prodromal syndromes were assessed using the Criteria of Prodromal Syndromes (COPS) based on the Structured Interview for Prodromal Syndromes(SIPS)

3.  Psychiatric diagnoses were determined via the Structured Clinical Interview (SCID) for DSM-IV

## Methods

c.  Help Seeking

d.  Met criteria for one or more prodromal syndromes

    1.  Attenuated psychotic symptoms
    2.  Brief intermittent psychotic symptoms
    3.  Substantial functional decline combine with a first degree relative with a psychotic disorder or schizotypal personality disorder in individuals younger than 18 years.

## Methods

#### Healthy Controls

    b.  Substance dependence in the past 6 months
    c.  IQ \< 70
    d.  Neurological disorder
